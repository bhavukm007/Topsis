# TOPSIS Assignment

This repository contains a complete and structured implementation of the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method.  
The project has been developed entirely using **Python and VS Code** and includes both a **command-line interface** and a **web-based interface** for ease of use.

## Project Overview

TOPSIS is a widely used **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** technique that helps in ranking alternatives based on their relative distance from an ideal best and an ideal worst solution.  
This implementation allows users to provide decision data, weights, and impacts to compute a ranked result set efficiently.

The project supports:
- CSV and Excel (`.xlsx`) input files  
- User-defined weights and impacts  
- Automatic calculation of TOPSIS scores and ranks  
- Output generation in CSV format  
- Web-based interaction using Flask

## Methodology

The TOPSIS algorithm follows the steps outlined below:

1. Read input data from CSV or Excel file  
2. Construct the decision matrix from numerical criteria  
3. Normalize the decision matrix  
4. Apply user-defined weights to each criterion  
5. Determine the ideal best and ideal worst solutions  
6. Compute Euclidean distances from ideal solutions  
7. Calculate the TOPSIS Score for each alternative  
8. Rank the alternatives based on the score

## Output Description

The final output generated by the system includes:
- **TOPSIS Score** for each alternative  
- **Rank** indicating relative preference order  

The output is stored in **CSV format** and can be easily reused for further analysis.

## Web Interface

In addition to the command-line execution, the project provides a **Flask-based web interface** where users can:
- Upload input files  
- Enter weights and impacts  
- Submit email details (optional)  
- Receive or store processed TOPSIS results  

This makes the system more accessible and user-friendly for non-technical users.
